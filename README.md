# libbin
Read, write and convert Binary data in Ruby.

## Philosophy

The goal of libbin is to provide a declarative way to describe binary files
formats. But, as this declarative approach is not always feasible or efficient,
it also provides more procedural approaches through a series of hooks that can
be used to override the behavior of the library.
